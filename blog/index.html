			<h3>Startup Institute - Week 1</h3>
			<p>A wide array of material was covered in the first week at Startup Institute, such as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Pursuing a Career in Startups</li>
				<li>Chicago Startup Ecosystem</li>
				<li>Intro to Lean Startup</li>
				<li>Intro to Emotional Intelligence</li>
				<li>Startup Financing</li>
				<li>Crafting a Career Theme</li>
				<li>Creative Confidence</li>
				<li>Viral Marketing</li>
				<li>Careers in Product & Design</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Needless to say I learned a lot, but here are the lessons that have stuck with me most while reflecting back on my first week:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Just Do It</strong> - Ideas aren’t worth much. Ideas need to be turned into fact so they can be tested and then can be learned from. It’s important for startups to turn their ideas into facts by creating a minimal viable product (MVP) and continually iterating to improve the MVP using A/B testing.</li>
				<li><strong>Emotional Intelligence</strong> - It’s important to be able to understand one’s own and other’s emotions in order to guide the thinking and actions of oneself and others.</li>
				<li><strong>Figure It Out</strong> - In the startup world there is a “figure it out” mentality, where people don’t always know what they are doing, but they work smart with a trial and error approach in order to solve problems.</li>
				<li><strong>Advice to Aspiring Front End Developers</strong> - If somebody wants to pursue a job as a front end developer, it is important to have a portfolio with examples of work, stay up to date with the latest web/mobile trends, and have an eye for design.</li>
				<li><strong>Personal Definition of Success</strong> - Solve problems that help people live fulfilling and prosperous lives while having fun doing it!</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>24 Hour Idea Hack</strong></p>
			<p>The biggest (and most fun!) event of the week was the Idea Hack, where our class was split up into teams and given 24 hours to solve some problems <a href="http://www.thinkchicago.net/">ThinkChicago</a> was facing. ThinkChicago is an organization whose mission is attract and develop STEM talent for the tech ecosystem in Chicago. At a high level, they are having problems bridging the gap between the supply and demand of the STEM job market in Chicago, so my team, which was comprised of one Technical Marketing, two Product & Design, and two Web Development students, came up with the idea to create an online platform that will allow ThinkChicago to bridge that gap between students and startups by setting up events in Chicago and on college campuses. The events will be created by ThinkChicago on the platform and then students and startups will be allowed to sign up for the upcoming events. Additionally, startups create open roles they need to fill with the required skills while students create a basic profile and apply for roles that they match with based on their skills. I created a rough HTML/CSS prototype of the platform, which can be found live online <a href="http://maxprimomershon.com/IdeaHackTeam4/">here</a> and on my GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/MaxPrimoMershon/MaxPrimoMershon.github.io/tree/master/IdeaHackTeam4">here</a>.</p>
