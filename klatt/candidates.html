                        <ul>
                            <li>It is always smart to schedule any interviews during lunch hours or before/after office hours. That way, you can usually accept temporary assignments and still work on your goal of full time employment.</li>
                            <li>If you do secure full time employment, please provide as much notice as possible. Employers will appreciate your commitment.</li>
                            <li>Always remember, we will provide a good reference for the quality work and good attitude you exhibit on temporary jobs.</li>
                            <li>Please notify us if you are offered employment from any firm or individual to whom you have been assigned to work as an employee of Klatt Temporary Service within a time period of 90 days from the date of completion of that assignment</li>

If you are unavailable to continue the assignment and we have advanced notice, we may be able to put another qualified temporary in your place, which increases the number of potential jobs for everyone.</p>
