			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I am currently a student at Startup Institute in the Product and Design track. Prior to SI, I worked as a Systems Integration Consulting Analyst at Accenture for 2 years after graduating from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a Bachelor's degree in General Engineering in May 2012.</p>
			<p>I am an explorer at heart. I love traveling internationally, taking road trips across the U.S., going to film festivals/TED type conferences/sporting events, and taking adventures into the wild. I am always open to trying new things and enjoy getting to know people who are different from myself and challenge my most basic assumptions about life.</p>
