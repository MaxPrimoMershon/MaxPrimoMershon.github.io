                            <p>When working as a business analyst helping create a web application for a Fortune 50 insurance company, it became quickly apparent that people who were making deicions about the functionailty of the app were not aware of how their decisions impacted the bigger picture. In effort to inform the decision-makers on the bigger picture, I created an end to end flow of the application and presented it to the leadership team, who received it well and had good insights on how to improve the app functionality. My ability to see the bigger picture makes me a good fit for the Product Manager role, who is the ultimate owner of the product, because the PM needs to make sure everybody is on the same page and working together towards the same goal.</p>

                            <p>While also working as a BA on the same insurance project previously described, a lot of changes were being made to the application's business requirements. In effort to minimize the number of changes, I worked with management to create metrics to analyze the changes being made and then propose a series of improvements to the requirements development process. In addition to visualizing the big picture, it is also important for Product Managers to be aware of the details because some of the biggest problems and opportunities can be discovered when identifying trends in the data of the details.</p>

                            <p>While a student in the Product and Design track at Startup Institute (Chicago), I learned a lot about various forms of the product design/development process. My personal favorite was the human-centered design (HCD) process because it focuses on the end-user and on getting work done at each step in the process. I decided to read "Creative Confidence", which describes HCD in greater depth, in order to learn more about it. I've been using the process in my lastest web design/dev projects, such as this one. My passion and ability to follow a results driven process that focuses on the user not only align's with Zen Planner's customer first philosophy, but it will also make sure the right work is getting done.</p>

                        <p>Bringing a diverse group of people and ideas together to achieve a common goal is the best thing about working with a team. I experienced this when on my last project at Accenture when I was on a team of ten analysts who were from five different countries (see picture). Our goal was to implement a software for a Fortune 100 chemicals company in North America. Each of us were given a set of chemical sites we were responsible for implementing the software at. We all learned a lot from each because everybody had a different way of communicating with our chemical sites.</p>

                        <p>Here are the top three things I love about fitness:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Diverse</strong> - Not everybody is built the same, which makes fitness awesome because there are many different forms of it. For example, my uncle golfs, my roommate does MMA, my good friend from college (see picture) teaches zumba, my dad does yoga, while I lift weights and hike.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tough</strong> - I love when fitness pushes people to their limits and past what they thought was possible. I get a kick out of watching corporate exec's in agony when running a marathon or retired veterans curse on the golf course when playing poorly. Fitness isn't easy!</li>
                            <li><strong>Positive</strong> - Fitness does not only have positive benefits to one's personal health, it also has positive benefits to one's mental health. I am personally interested in positive psychology and there has been a lot of research done lately on the benefits that exercise has on mental health.</li>
